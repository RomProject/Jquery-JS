 <p id="p1">
 Hello! my name is Rom Lubianiker.<br><br>    
 For the last 12 years of my life,my main ocuptaion was music.<br>
During the covid year I decided to open my horizons to somthing complitly diffrent,<br>and that is Web devlopment of course (:.
<br>
The studies at JB academy so far has been a thrill for me,<br>
Im learning alot of diffrent things , and every day of studying <br>presents it self with another challange to overcome.
<br>
I'm hoping I'll whould continue to overcome any diffculties along the way<br>,thanks to  my hard work ,  and my great teacher .(:

<h1>Project #2</h1>
<p>
This project hasnt been easy.<br>
It took alot of reaserch and time.<br>But,beacuse of its complexity , <br> I feel I improved my programming skills dramaticly.
I've spend  a lot of hours online<br> searching for the diffrent JQUERY functions.><br><br>
Beacuse of that I've got to know the<br> JQUERY librery alot better.Hopefully it would pay off when ill get my first<br> developer job (:
